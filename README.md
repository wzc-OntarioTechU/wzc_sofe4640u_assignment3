Assignment 3 for the Mobile Applications Course SOFE4640U.

## Due Date

November 27th, 2024 23:59 EST

## Objectives

Practice mobile application development using Flutter and Dart.

## Instructions

Create a food ordering app with the following requirements:
1. Create a database and store at least 20 preferred food items and cost pairs.
2. User can select a "target cost per day", "date", and select the food item from the list to not exceed the target amount
3. User then save the selected food items (order plan) into the database with a date.
4. A query feature in the app to display order plan for a date (if found in the database)
5. An add, delete, and update feature in the app to add, delete, or update entries.

In the courses’ lectures, we have discussed many best practices for developing mobile apps, as
well as best practices for the Android platform. Part of your mark will be allocated based on how
well you adhere to those best practices. Other best practices you should be following include
proper variable/method naming, and reasonably documented code. This means you don’t need to
document every line of code, but some of the high-level functionality.

## Assignment Submission

You can use a GitHub account to upload your project. Submit a zip file in canvas containing the following:
1. Folder containing the app source code.
2. A maximum three page report explaining how each steps of the application are implemented and please provide the GitHub reference in the report.
